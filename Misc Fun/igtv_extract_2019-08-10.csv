Full lyrics below:

Sometimes you wonder
“Am I ever going to get my break”
But you’re the real deal, you never fake it…
You know you’re going to make it!

Even when the game’s a ‘foul out’
If coach never seems to look your way
There’s no shame, you keep your head in the game…
Tomorrow everybody’s gonna’ know your name!

Play By Play
Nothing’s going to stand in your way
The shot at buzzer
No worries, no sweat
As long as you ‘believe’
It’s going nothing but net

Play By Play
Never looking back… to yesterday

Oh…
Moving off the sideline
Taking your shot
It’s a slam dunk you’re headed…
Straight to the top…",47,1489,2018-06-21T23:36:45,100665,1:07,Jimmy Fallon & NBA Draft Stars '90s Sitcom Theme,https://www.instagram.com/tv/BkThzo1j82q/
